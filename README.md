Prediction of Weight Lifting Style using Accelerometer Data

Introduction

With the availability of low cost accelerometers, there are many opportunities to measure human activities. 
One application of this is measuring the proper form of weight lifting]. This prject examine whether it could 
determine the weight lifting form using the accelerometer data collected.
